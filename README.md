# Python for Machine Learning

_Python_, _Numpy_ and _Matplotlib_ basics with examples,
for Machine Learning beginners.

## Content summary

The lectures were presented during the course 
_[Python Programming for Machine Learning](https://wiki.ml.tu-berlin.de/wiki/Main/SS17_PythonKurs)_,
at _TU Berlin: Technische Universität Berlin_, in the 2017's Summer Semester,
held by Professor Grégoire Montavon. 

Each of the 4 lectures are Jupyter Notebooks, exported as _pdf_ files,
with examples of basic concepts from subjects related to 
_Python_, _Numpy_, _Matplotlib_ and _Machine Learning algorithms_.

In the assignments folders you can find the 4 given homeworks,
corresponding to each lecture.
Each folder contains the original requirements, 
the solved version with feedback from the reviewers
and any additional material generated or used during the task.

### Lecture 1

Introduction into _Python_ programming with:
  - the traditional "hello world";
  - some data structures: lists, dictionaries;
  - functions & classes;
  - _Functional Programming_ concepts: 
  list comprehension, map, filter & !__reduce__!;
  - ! __Reading Data from Files__ !
 
Have some fun by following a simple Python implementation 
of a _Decision Tree_. 

Try to distinguish between fruits based on their color and size.

### Lecture 2

Introduction into _Numpy_ and _Matplotlib_ libraries.

Why and when should one use _Numpy_? You will see time performance arguments,
and useful tricks for matrix manipulations 
(such as indexing, reshaping, broadcasting, ...).

How to plot graphs?

Take a grasp of the __Boston dataset__  from _sklearn_ library. 
Analyze and find insides about the data. 


### Lecture 3

Simulate random processes, such as _Monte Carlo Markov Chain_, with _Numpy_.

Brief talk about integrating highly optimized functions,
written in C/C++, Fortran or Cuda, into your Python code.

Apply these concepts in image filtering.

### Lecture 4

__Rounding__, __Overflow__ and __Linear Algebra__.

Analyze what problems can appear when working with large numbers in _Numpy_.

Short implementation of the Linear Regression 
and the Principal Component Analysis algorithms.

### Final Exam

Test the main topics discussed in the lectures.

### Universal Approximation

Presentation made for the 
[Neural Networks Seminary](http://wiki.ml.tu-berlin.de/wiki/Main/SS17_NN). 
Proof of the _Neural Networks' Universal Approximation Theorem_.
